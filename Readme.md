# Task Management Assistant for Neurodivergent Teens
        
SUMMARY 
When you open Kaikoon, you first see a quick logo screen, then a two-step setup that asks for your grade and which classes you take. After that, you land on the main to-do list it shows your current Kaiblooms points, any tasks you’ve added, and a big plus button. Tap the plus, type a task, and hit Break into steps the app uses ChatGPT to suggest smaller sub-tasks and the materials you’ll need. You set how many minutes you think the whole task will take, save it, and the task appears on your list. When you tap that task, you see its step-by-step checklist and a timer—you can start, pause, or reset it while you work. Once every sub-task is checked off and you stop the timer, a Finish button pops up. Press Finish, pick an emoji to show how you feel, write a short reflection, and the app labels your text as positive, neutral, or negative. You instantly earn Kaiblooms points, get a Great job message, and return to the main list ready to add or tackle the next task.
MAIN PROBLEM 
Neurodivergent teens often forget materials, miss task-start cues, and abandon homework midway because executive-function skills are hard for them to self-manage.
MAIN SOLUTION 
Kaikoon is a mobile micro-coach that turns everyday school prep and study sessions into short, reward-based missions.
